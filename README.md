### Key Features

1. **Customizable Data Presentation**  
   Easily control how data is presented in your API responses. Resource collections allow you to transform your Lucid model data into any desired format before sending it to the client.

2. **Transform Collections of Lucid Models**  
   Resource collections are particularly useful when dealing with collections of database records. You can define how each item in the collection is transformed into a consistent and structured format suitable for API responses.

3. **Flexible Field Transformations**  
   Customize the structure of your data by adding, removing, or modifying fields. This gives you complete control over the data being returned, ensuring your API responses are clean and tailored to your needs.

4. **Relationship Support**  
   Seamlessly include related models in your resource collections. By nesting related data, you reduce the number of requests needed by the client, optimizing performance and enhancing the user experience.

5. **Conditional Field Inclusion**  
   Conditionally include or exclude fields based on custom logic. This feature allows your API to adapt its response structure depending on the request or the data being processed, providing maximum flexibility.
